# My CV - Christian Andrés López Valdez

This project is a personal CV website built with React and Bootstrap. It showcases my professional experience, skills, certifications, and courses.
The deployment was done with GitHub Pages and set a custom domain [https://lpz.mx/](https://lpz.mx/)

Nothing too fancy, but needed for oversharing details about responsabilities or showcasing my general domain knowledge as nobody likes to read a resume bigger than 1 page.

## Features

- Display professional experience with details and skills
- List certifications and courses
- Responsive design with Bootstrap
- Lazy loading for components
- Alert notification on page load

## TODOs

 - Add years of experience per tool / skill / framework / language
 - Add a simple description per job
 - Enhance the way the bullets of responsabilities are displayed
 - Add a PDF downloadble version
